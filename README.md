# PrefixOpen
Chrome extension to prepend selection with prefix and open as URL in a new tab.

## What is this?
This extension was developed after my frustration at work where the ID for a ticket would be on a web page, but not a link, requiring me to search or otherwise break my concentration and deal with the ticket system rather than my work.

However, I've named it 'Prefix Open', because I made it a tiny bit configurable, and now you can use it to prefix any text with any URL. The example I use in the Web Store description is sub-reddits - prefixed by 'https://reddit.com/r/'.

## How do I use this?
Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), and then click the orange '+' icon to set your prefix.

When working in Chrome, if you come across a suffix you want to look at, highlight it, right click, and select 'Open with prefix'.

## Privacy Concerns
I get it, we live in a world where I have to say this, but: we do *not* store, collect, upload, or download any information about who is using this extension, where they
are using it, how they are using it, why they are using it, or what they use it for/on. A more detailed privacy policy is available on [the web site](https://prefix.findlays.io/privacy).
