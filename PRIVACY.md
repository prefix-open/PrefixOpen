# Privacy Policy
_Effective Date: 19/04/2022_

# We don't collect any data
In summary, we do not collect or share any data about our users or their machines. If this information isn't collected, it cannot be stolen, leaked, abused or sold. Protecting this data by not collecting it is the best way we can work together to protect your privacy.

## How we define "personal data"
Our personal belief is that any data about you or your behavior is your personal property, and we have no right to it. This is based upon, in part, the legal framework of the privacy laws of New Zealand, in part by the framework provided by the GDPR, and mostly based upon an (oft unhealthy) lifetime of Stallman and Doctorow.

## Information we don't collect
So let's be perfectly clear:

+ **We don't have access to your IP address**

  The nature of our software is such that we do not have access to, and therefore cannot store, your IP address. Our software is local to the browser that runs it, and does not 'phone home'.
+ **We don't set or read any cookies**

  We do not set or read any cookies through the extension that can be used to track or identify you in any way.
+ **We don't ask for your details**

  We don't ask for your name, age, address, contact details, or passwords. We have no need or want for this information. If you contact us, we will use your contact information only to respond to you. We will never sell or share this information with anyone else.
+ **We can't hand over your data to a government**

  They can ask, but we cannot supply information we never had in the first place. Any request for your data will come from the relevant New Zealand authorities, and we will comply if we are legally required to do so; however, we are unlikely to receive such requests, as we don't actually have any data to hand over.

## Google Chrome Sync
I have leveraged Chrome's synced storage provider so that you don't have to set your prefix every time you use this extension, on any machine. This means, in some cases, Google and Chrome will take the un-encrypted string containing your prefix and transmit it (possibly even store it) using their networks and servers. If you do not want this, do not use this extension. (Or fork it on GitHub and change `chrome.storage.sync` to `chrome.storage.local` - I think that'll do it).
